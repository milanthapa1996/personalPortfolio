## What Is Git and Why Is It Used? 

[Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a distributed version control system that helps developers track changes in their codebase, collaborate on projects, and maintain code history. It is widely used in software development to manage code efficiently and ensure team collaboration.

## Key Features of Git

- **Version Control**: Tracks changes in your codebase, allowing you to revert to previous states.  
- **Branching and Merging**: Enables developers to work on multiple features simultaneously.  
- **Distributed System**: Every user has a complete local copy of the repository.  
- **Staging Area**: Provides control over which changes to commit.  
- **Integration**: Works seamlessly with platforms like [GitHub](https://github.com) and [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/) for remote collaboration.

## Basic Git Interview Questions and Answers

## 1. What is Git?
Git is a version control system that allows you to track and manage changes to code in a collaborative environment. For more details, check out the official Git website [here](https://git-scm.com/).

## 2. What is a repository in Git?
A repository is a directory where your project files and their version history are stored. It can be local or remote. You can learn more about repositories on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub?
Git is the version control system; [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a platform that hosts Git repositories, offering additional features like collaboration and issue tracking.

## 4. How does Git work?
Git works by tracking changes in files. It stores snapshots of files in a version-controlled directory, enabling developers to switch between versions and collaborate. For more information on how Git works, visit [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2).

## 5. What is a commit in Git?
A commit in Git is a snapshot of the changes made to the repository. Each commit has a unique ID that helps identify the changes made at that point. You can read more about commits in Git on the [Git documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc).

## 6. What is branching in Git?
Branching allows developers to work on different tasks independently. Each branch is like a separate workspace, and changes can be merged later. Learn more about branching in Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Branches-in-a-Nutshell).

## 7. What is a merge in Git?
A merge is the process of combining changes from two branches. Git will attempt to automatically combine the changes, but conflicts might arise. For more about merging in Git, visit [Git merging guide](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Merging).

## 8. What is a conflict in Git?
A conflict happens when two branches have made changes to the same part of a file. Git cannot automatically merge the changes and requires manual intervention. Check out how to resolve merge conflicts [here](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge).

## 9. What is a pull request?
A pull request is a request to merge changes from one branch into another, usually from a feature branch into the main branch. Learn more about pull requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/).

## 10. What is git fetch vs git pull?
`git fetch` downloads changes from the remote repository but does not merge them. `git pull` fetches and automatically merges the changes into your current branch.

```bash
git fetch origin
git pull origin main
```

## 11. How do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?
Use `git revert` to create a new commit that undoes the changes of a previous commit.

```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```

## 12. What is a .gitignore file?
A `.gitignore` file specifies which files or directories should not be tracked by Git. For example:

```bash
# Ignore node_modules
node_modules/
```

## 13. How do you clone a repository?
Use `git clone` followed by the repository URL to make a copy of the remote repository on your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/user/repository.git
```

## 14. What is git stash?
`git stash` temporarily saves changes that are not yet ready to be committed. You can retrieve them later using `git stash apply`. Learn more about [git stash](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-stash).

## 15. How do you view the commit history?
Use `git log` to view the commit history.

```bash
git log
```

## 16. What is a remote in Git?
A remote is a reference to a remote repository. Common commands include `git push` to upload changes and `git pull` to retrieve changes. For more details, check out the [Git documentation on remotes](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Remote-Branches).

## 17. How do you create a new branch?
Use `git branch` to create a new branch.

```bash
git branch new-branch
```

## 18. What is `git merge --squash`?
`git merge --squash` combines multiple commits into one before merging. Learn more about [squash merging](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_squash).

## 19. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Open the conflicting file, make necessary changes, and then commit the resolved file.

```bash
git add <resolved_file>
git commit
```

## 20. What is git rebase?
`git rebase` re-applies commits on top of another base commit. It can help create a cleaner project history. For more information, visit the [Git documentation on rebasing](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-rebase).

## 21. What is the difference between git merge and git rebase?
`git merge` creates a merge commit, while `git rebase` rewrites the history and applies commits on top of the latest commit. Learn more about [git merge vs. git rebase](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/merging-vs-rebasing).

## 22. How do you change the last commit?
Use `git commit --amend` to modify the last commit.

```bash
git commit --amend
```
